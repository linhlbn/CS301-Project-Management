## III/ <a id='description'></a>Description

We have utilized Django's model-view-controller (MVC) architecture to structure our project making it easier to create scalable and secure applications. Models define the data structure, views handle the logic and processing, and templates handle the presentation and user interface. This separation of concerns allows for efficient development and maintenance of our application.

Through close collaboration and an iterative approach, we will showcase our growth as skilled developers and effective team work skills.

The project is currently in progress, and the team is committed to meeting the project milestones and delivering successful outcomes.
